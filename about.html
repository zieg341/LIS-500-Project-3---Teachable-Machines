                <p>I'm a senior majoring in Information Science with certificates in Digital Studies and Science Communication. I’m also a member of the Wisconsin Alumni Student Board (WASB) on campus. This past summer, I interned as a Web Developer in Tanzania, and in the spring I will spend my last semester at UW as a Digital Marketing intern in Finland - I love to travel! In the future, I hope to continue traveling and to pursue a career in UX design.</p>
