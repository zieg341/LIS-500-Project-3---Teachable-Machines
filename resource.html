            <p><strong>Overview</strong><br>Implicit biases, also referred to as unconscious biases, are societal stereotypes that individuals unconsciously form about groups of people, separate from their own conscious awareness.</p>

        <!-- Section 2: Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT) -->
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h2>2. Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
            <p><strong>Overview of IBT</strong><br> The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) measures the strength of associations between concepts and evaluations or stereotypes to reveal an individual’s hidden or subconscious biases.</p><br>
            <p><strong>Our Discussion of IBT</strong><br> We discussed how IBT measures the strength of associations between concepts and stereotypes, revealing subconscious biases that might not be apparent otherwise. These biases often operate below the surface of our conscious thoughts, impacting our decisions and actions. Connecting this to our course readings and videos, we can see how these hidden biases reflect social structures, such as those in the tech industry, that reinforce power imbalances and exclusionary practices.<br><br>

                In <a href="images/nakumara.pdf" target="blank">Nakumara's "Indigenous Circuits",</a> we see how racialized and gendered power dynamics shaped the tech industry from its inception. Indigenous labor, particularly Navajo women, was exploited to create modern technology like semiconductors. The comparison of Navajo weaving skills to circuit design is particularly revealing of the way subconscious biases might play a role in how Indigenous people’s skills are interpreted. The romanticization of their weaving as a "natural" fit for tech labor aligns with the type of subconscious bias the IBT measures, as it reduces Navajo culture to fit desired narratives. This view assumes an inherent, rather than learned, ability—denying these communities agency and the opportunity to be recognized as equal contributors. This reductionist framing signifies the implicit biases that the IBT aims to uncover, suggesting that our cultural frameworks still subtly reinforce stereotypes.
                
            One point of contention in is whether this comparison perpetuates stereotypes about the "natural" abilities of Indigenous people, rather than celebrating their skills as learned and developed. The notion that certain groups are naturally predisposed to certain tasks is a form of implicit bias that erases the complexity of their cultural and technical contributions.</p><br>

        <!-- Section 3: Intersectionality -->
        <div class="resource-item">
            <h2>3. Intersectionality</h2>
            <p><strong>Definition and Origin</strong> <br>Intersectionality is a sociological framework that examines how social and political identities interact to create unique experiences of discrimination and privilege. In the context of this class, we discuss intersectioanily as a way of thinking that takes into consideration the perspectives and experiences of individuals from underrepresented groups and  marginalized populations. An intersectional approach recognizes that one’s social location―oftentimes shaped by race, class, gender  and other dimensions of who we are―creates multiple, interconnected identities and distinct experiences.<br><em> Click on the video below to learn more about intersectioanily!</em> </p>
